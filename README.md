Here's my own take at the ROT13 cipher.

The idea came after completing [Caesar's Cipher](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher) in FreeCodeCamp.

At first I was struggling on how to encrypt the text but later, with some research I realized it is the exact same function so I just copy pasted. This defeats the purpose of having two fields but this is a foundation to me so in the future I can create my own cipher and create a website just to play around with friends and hopefully use the two fields separately.
