Here's my own take at the ROT13 cipher.

The idea came after completing - [Caesar's Cipher] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher) - in FreeCodeCamp.

At first I was strugglin with how to encrypt the text but later with some research I realized is the exact same function so I just copy pasted. I expected more of a challenge but this is a foundation to me so in the future I can create my own cipher and create a website just to play around with friends.
